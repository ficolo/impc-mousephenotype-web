## Project architecture

This project is configured using [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) and [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to support the monorepo pattern, making it easier to produce both a full Single Page Application and a set of self contained widgets that can be used independently in any website (e.g. the CMS pages use to present static content at mousephenotype.org). The source code is distributed in the following structure:

```
packages
├── components
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public
│   ├── src
│   ├── tsconfig.esm.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── web-app
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public
│   ├── src
│   └── tsconfig.json
└── widgets
    └── late-adult-heatmap
            ├── package.json
            ├── src
            └── tsconfig.json
```

The components package is where most of our could should reside and it's a dependency of the web-app package and the different widgets package.

### Components package

The components package is our component library, is supposed to be a presentation layer that knows the minimum about our domain and data sources as possible. A component shouldn't get data directly from any of our data sources, that responsibility should be delegated to the components wrapping our singular rendering unit, like the widget components in the widgets packages or the pages components in our web-app package.

The components library is powered by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

Just remember, keep your components simple, as simple as possible.
